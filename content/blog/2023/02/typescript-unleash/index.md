TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features that can help developers write more maintainable and scalable code. By using TypeScript, developers can catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime, which can lead to fewer bugs and easier debugging. Additionally, TypeScript's enhanced typing system can help make code more self-documenting and improve developer productivity. Overall, TypeScript is a great choice for any project that is looking for a more robust and scalable codebase.

Here is a simple example of a TypeScript class that represents a point in a two-dimensional coordinate system:

```ts
class Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;

    constructor(x: number, y: number) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    distanceFromOrigin(): number {
        return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
    }
}

let point = new Point(3, 4);
console.log(point.distanceFromOrigin());  // Output: 5
```

In this example, we have a `Point` class with two properties `x` and `y` which are both of type number. The class also has a constructor that takes two parameters `x` and `y` of type number and assigns them to the corresponding properties. The class also has a method `distanceFromOrigin` which calculates and returns the distance of the point from the origin.

The use of TypeScript's type system in this example allows for better code readability, and catch potential bugs like passing a string instead of number, in early stages of development.
